    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm glad you're here. This is my first homework assignment and I'm pretty stoked about it</p>
    <p> I am from Springfield, Virginia and moved to florida in October 2017. I have a BA in Sociology from Christopher Newport University. For the past 8 years, I've worked in Human Resources for a law firm in Alexandria, Virginia. In 2016, I earned my Senior Professional in Human Resources Certification</p>
    <p> Besides learning to code, I also spend my free time training for a half-marathon, and rowing in the mornings with the South Orlando Rowing Association. Another passion of mine is skin care, and I also am a rep for the beauty brand Glossier. I also enjoy spending time with my husband, cooking, and watching any Real Housewives franchise. </p>
